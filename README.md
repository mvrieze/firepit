I am porting a bunch of my favorite analytics processes and tools from SAS and other software into Python. I am so impressed with the Python language's ability to give me complete control of my analysis and the ability to follow paths which the data leads me to. Often, I need to craft a specific interpretation of results from my data sets while referencing a text. This is especially useful for interpreting interaction effects or when accounting for non-linear relationships between features and targets. 

I am using the Anaconda distribution of Python: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
